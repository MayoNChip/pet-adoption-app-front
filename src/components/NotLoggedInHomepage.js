            You can give a homeless animal a second chance through adoption
            instead of purchasing from a pet shop. Animal welfare groups usually
            have a wide variety of pets for adoption. These pets have been
            sterilised, and screened for good behaviour before matching them
            with potential pet owners. If there are adoption fees, they go
            towards paying for medical needs, such as sterilisation, deworming
            and vaccination, and the administrative cost of the adoption.
